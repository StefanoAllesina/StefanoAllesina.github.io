We have been working on the applications of random matrix theory to ecology for four years. By now, it is quite clear that the most important challenge ahead is to extend the theory to the case of structured networks (as described&nbsp;[here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10144-014-0471-0)). A new study we just published is a first step in this direction:

In this work, we studied community matrices produced according to the cascade model, in which "big fish eat little fish". These matrices look like this:

These matrices produce&nbsp;a peculiar spectrum, suggestive of an "eyeball":

In the paper, we derive simple, analytical results that allow us to approximate the spectrum (and hence the stability) of the&nbsp;eyeball.

&nbsp;I wrote an R package that performs the analysis described in the paper, and published it on [github](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/eyeball).

PS: Despite the quote from the Beatles above, all I could listen to&nbsp;while writing the paper was Pink Floyd. Maybe because I remember [another eyeball I saw a long time ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=bz2tcbDfY2A#t=74)...
