I have written a short "[Behind the paper](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/channels/521-behind-the-paper)" post for the Nature Ecology & Evolution Community, which [you can find here](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/channels/521-behind-the-paper/posts/18885-for-ecological-interactions-3-2).

James O'Dwyer&nbsp;has written a [News & Views commentary](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature23103.html).

Rob Mitchum has [covered this work for the Computation Institute](https://ci.uchicago.edu/press-releases/new-ecological-model-generates-diversity-chain-head-head-battles)'s website.

I have presented this work at several conferences. Here's a video of my talk at the BES annual meeting in Liverpool (Dec 2016, ~30 mins):
