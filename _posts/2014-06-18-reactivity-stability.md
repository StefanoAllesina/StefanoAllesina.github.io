After studying the stability of large ecological networks, we wanted to try to describe the transient dynamics following a small perturbation of the equilibrium. We thus studied "reactivity", which tells us whether perturbations of a stable equilibrium are going to be amplified before decaying.

The paper is now out:

Si Tang & Stefano Allesina  
[Reactivity and stability of large ecosystems  
](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/91687/abstract "Reactivity and stability of large ecosystems")

which we published in [frontiers in Ecology and Evolution](http://www.frontiersin.org/Ecology_and_Evolution), a new journal with an interesting peer-review scheme (a topic dear to my heart!). In fact, I am so happy journals are trying new ways of doing peer review I decided to join the editorial board.
