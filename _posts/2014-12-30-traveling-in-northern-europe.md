Just before the Winter break, I've been traveling in Sweden and the Netherlands. In Linköping, I gave a 3-hr lecture on the stability of large ecological systems for the 6th Swedish Meeting in Mathematics in Biology. It was a great experience, and it was so nice to get to see my former postdoc [Anna Eklöf](https://annaeklof.wordpress.com/)and spend some time with her and her family.

In the Netherlands, I was part of a workshop on [Spatio-Temporal Dynamics in Ecology](http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2014/663/info.php3?wsid=663&venue=Oort) at the Lorentz Center in Leiden. This is a great place for workshops, and I think I will organize one in the near future!
