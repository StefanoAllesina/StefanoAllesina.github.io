<p>In Italy in the 1970s, youth belonging to counterculture movements would march in the streets, parading a copy of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Tse-tung">Little Red Book</a>Â  containing quotations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.</p>
<p>Yesterday I turned 40, and to celebrate this very round anniversary, Gyuri, Jacopo, Liz and Matt presented me with a Little Black Book containing many of the things I often repeat, or particularly memorable utterances.</p>
<p><a href="http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blackbook.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-456"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-456" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/06/blackbook-1024x910.jpg" alt="blackbook" width="604" height="537" /></a></p>
<p>This was a truly moving gift, which made me laugh out loud ---
my labmates know me too well! (It also made me think that I am slowly becoming a&nbsp;grumpy old professor, always repeating the same Mantras)

I will keep the notebook in the lab, so that whenever someone feels the urge to record memorable quotations, they can be saved for posterity.
