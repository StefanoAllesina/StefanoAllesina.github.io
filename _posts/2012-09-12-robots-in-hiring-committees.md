When I sit in a hiring committee, I ask myself: is it even possible to predict who's going to be a good scientist by looking at a CV? It turns out that yes, it is possible.

A piece in Nature on the delicate topic of measuring scientists productivity. Daniel Acuna, Konrad Kording and I tried to predict the future h-index of neuroscientists. You can find the article here:

Daniel E. Acuna, Stefano Allesina & Konrad P. Kording  
[Future impact: Predicting scientific success](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489201a.html)  
Nature 489, 201â€“202

Nature has an editorial on this work:  
[Count on me](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489177a.html)

Some of the coverage:
