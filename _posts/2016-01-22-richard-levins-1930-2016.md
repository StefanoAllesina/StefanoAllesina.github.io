Sad news for theoretical ecology: on Jan 19th, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Levins">Richard Levins</a> died in Cambridge, MA. He was 85 years old.

His work has always been my main source of inspiration. I got to read some of his articles in college, when <a href="http://www.antoniobodini.com/">Antonio Bodini</a>---who was then to become my PhD avisor---introduced <a href="http://ipmnet.org/loop/">Loop Analysis</a> in a class on Environmental Impact Assessment. I immediately loved the simplicity, elegance, and power of this method, and I worked on it for my honors thesis (with <a href="http://www.math.unipr.it/~zaccagni/">Alessandro Zaccagnini</a> and Antonio Bodini).

During my PhD years, I've read more of his work, including the wonderful (yet almost impossible to find) book with Charles Puccia, and the celebrated articles "<a href="https://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/models/levins.modelbuilding.pdf">The strategy of model building in population biology</a>" and "Evolution in communities near equilibrium".

All my work on stability, random matrices, and population dynamics has been inspired by Loop Analysis, and even today when I see a matrix, I actually see a composition of loops and paths.

Even the fact I am now in Chicago is somewhat influenced by Levins: he and Lewontin were professors here in the 1960s, and that's why when I saw the ad for the position in Ecology &amp; Evolution, I immediately felt I had to apply---this is my kind of Department!

There's a nice picture of Levins in the Lillie Room downstairs: you can see him in his prime, explaining Loop Analysis on the board. That's the way I want to remember him.
