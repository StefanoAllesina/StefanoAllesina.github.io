I am at the Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. I am teaching about 60 students from all over the world (really from all over, not only from Europe and North America) my class on scientific computing. It is really great to interact with these students, plus, this is the view from my room! (not to mention the excellent coffee) [![ICTP view]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/06/IMG_20140618_120106-300x225.jpg)](http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_20140618_120106.jpg)
