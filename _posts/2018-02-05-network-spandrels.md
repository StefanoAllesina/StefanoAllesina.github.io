<p>Biological networks show strong departures from simple models of random graphs. For example, they display broader degree distributions, high modularity, and strong preponderance of certain motifs.</p>
<p>One might be tempted to interpret these features as a signal of a selective force pruning the space of possible networks, resulting in empirical networks possessing certain features.</p>
<p>In one of my all-time favorite papers, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534706001674">Ricard Solé &amp; Sergi Valverde</a> proposed an alternative explanation: these features might be by-products of how the network was assembled. They dubbed this the "network-spandrel" hypothesis, referencing the famous paper by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/77447">Gould &amp; Lewontin</a>.</p>
<p>In a new paper just published in Ecology Letters, Dan Maynard, Carlos Serván and I show a simple model of ecological assembly where by slightly tweaking the rules of assembly we can obtain dramatically different network structures---
a paradigmatic case of network spandrels:

Notably, the idea of network spandrels will be the focus of a [Satellite Session](https://liphlab.github.io/) at [NetSci 2018](https://www.netsci2018.com/) in Paris. The satellite is [being organized](https://liphlab.github.io/#contact) by many of the current and past collaborators of the lab.
