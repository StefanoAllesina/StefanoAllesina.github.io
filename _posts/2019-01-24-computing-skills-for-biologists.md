<p>After years in the making, "Computing Skills for Biologists ---
a Toolbox" is finally out!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The book covers [many topics](http://computingskillsforbiologists.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ComputingSkillsforBiologists_TOC.pdf), including the Unix shell, programming in Python and R, LaTeX, and relational databases. It shows how these tools can be integrated to build powerful pipelines for the automated, rigorous and reproducible analysis of biological data.
