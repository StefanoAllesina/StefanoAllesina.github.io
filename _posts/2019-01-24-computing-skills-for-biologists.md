After years in the making, "Computing Skills for Biologists --- a Toolbox" is finally out!


The book covers [many topics](http://computingskillsforbiologists.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ComputingSkillsforBiologists_TOC.pdf), including the Unix shell, programming in Python and R, LaTeX, and relational databases. It shows how these tools can be integrated to build powerful pipelines for the automated, rigorous and reproducible analysis of biological data.

You can find the book on the website of [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/13268.html), or on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Computing-Skills-Biologists-Stefano-Allesina/dp/0691182752) and other sellers.

A big thanks to my co-author Madlen Wilmes, to Alison Kalett and her team at PUP, and to the students who helped us making the material more interesting and fun.
