With the new year, I've been invited to join the [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/) as an External Faculty, and the Editorial Board of [PLoS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/editorial-board).

[![nico-logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/02/nico-logo.jpg)](http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nico-logo.jpg)[NICO](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/index.html) is an institute dedicated to the study of complex systems, and is part of Northwestern University, in Evanston (a short train ride from Chicago). It is directed by [Luis Amaral](http://amaral-lab.org/people/amaral/) and [Brian Uzzi](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/htm/), two of the best researchers working at the interface of networks and complex systems. I am very much looking forward to work with the faculty there, and I am very interested in the courses and conferences organized by the Center.

[![ploscb-logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/02/ploscb-logo.png)](http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ploscb-logo.png)[PLoS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/) is one of my favorite journals. I've published seven papers in the journal so far (three last year: [1](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004205), [2](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004251), [3](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004330)), and I often reviewed and guest-edited for the journal. I am very happy to join the board as an Associate Editor, and I hope this will help increase the number of submissions from ecologists, as well as foster a dialogue between quantitative ecologists and other biologists interested in the computational, statistical, and mathematical aspects of the discipline.
