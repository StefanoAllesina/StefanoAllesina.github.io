[![RMT-Product]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/01/RMT-Product-300x171.png)](http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RMT-Product.png)In October 2013, I was a speaker at the [29th&nbsp;Annual Meeting of the Society of Population Ecology](http://www.geocities.jp/populecol29/e/keynotes-e.html), held in Osaka, Japan. The invitation came with the possibility of writing an article for a special issue of the journal Population Ecology.

&nbsp;

I thought that this would be a great occasion to review the progress my laboratory has made on&nbsp;the study of the stability of large ecological systems. Even better, this article could outline a research program on this topic, listing the main challenges that we are facing.

My former student Si Tang (now pursuing a second PhD in Statistics) and I set to work with this idea in mind. You can now read this hybrid between a review and a list of "grand challenges":

_Stefano Allesina & Si Tang_  
_[The stabilityâ€“complexity relationship at age 40: a random matrix perspective](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10144-014-0471-0)_  
_Population Ecology, 2015_

Our hope is that all the challenges we list will be solved by the time May's 1972 paper turns 50.
