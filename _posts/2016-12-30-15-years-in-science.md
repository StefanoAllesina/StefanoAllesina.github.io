Hard to believe, but I've been working in science for fifteen years! Many things have happened since I started my PhD in Antonio Bodini's lab in&nbsp;Parma, but I [still](http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/?p=108) have fun doing my job, and I am extremely grateful for the fantastic students, postdocs and colleagues who&nbsp;have been working with me through the years. The anniversary&nbsp;calls for a song!

_studying large matrices and their eigenvalues_  
_teaching to code and to despise p-values_  
_watching your students give excellent talks_  
_these are a few of my favorite things_

_reviewing good papers that are bright and novel_  
_writing nice code to implement a new model_  
_having a coffee with my lab and friends_  
_these are a few of my favorite things_

_finding a method to do something crazy_  
_I will keep searching until I turn lazy_  
_sending proposals before they are due_  
_these are a few of my favorite things_

_when the grant bites_  
_when reviews sting_  
_when I'm feeling mad_  
_I simply remember my favorite things_  
_and then I can start over_

Last week,&nbsp;I was at the National Gallery in DC, and I've stumbled upon the [painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Magritte)) that is featured as&nbsp;the first slide of most of my talks. I think it's a perfect metaphor of science: the reality is out there, we have a small window to observe it, and we want to compose a simplified picture to understand what is going on. May I'll still be happy to peer through the window in 2032!
