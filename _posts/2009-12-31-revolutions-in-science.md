> Author and physicist Mark Buchanan comments on my preprint on modeling peer review in Nature Physics

A nice piece on a possible revolution in science coming from a radical change in the way basic practices of science are carried out. The article discusses in details the project outlined in [this preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0344).

"However, some more radical proposals are beginning to target the shortcomings of the publication process itself. For example, ecologist Stefano Allesina has explored the idea that journals might bid on the manuscripts they want to publish."
