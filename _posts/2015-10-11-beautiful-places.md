<p>Traveling is quite disruptive, especially when you have a family at home, and a lab to run. However, having to travel to incredibly beautiful destinations to meet old friends makes the whole ordeal much more pleasant.</p>
<p>I have just returned to Chicago after a week in Monterey, CA, where I taught a short course on computing at the <a href="http://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/">Hopkins Marine Station</a> of Stanford University. The class was great, and the organizer was my friend <a href="https://sites.stanford.edu/deleolab/">Giulio De Leo</a>. I got to spend some time with <a href="https://sites.stanford.edu/deleolab/">Giulio</a> and <a href="http://micheli.stanford.edu/micheli.html">Fiorenza</a>, as well as to interact with an incredibly motivated group of students. I also gave a talk at Hopkins and one at the main campus in Palo Alto. This is what I would see when I went for a run:</p>

<p>Just before heading to Stanford, I have been in Venezia, Italy, for a <a href="http://www.pd.infn.it/~maritan/SanServolo/">school</a> on complex systems, organized by Antonio Trovato, Samir Suweis and our very own Jacopo Grilli. Again, the school was great, and the location---in San Servolo island---
unbeatable:

These trips energized me a lot, but I am really happy to be home for a good stretch of time!
