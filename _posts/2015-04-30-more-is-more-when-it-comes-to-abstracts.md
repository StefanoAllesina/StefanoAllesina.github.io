In the summer of 2013, I was coordinating a class meant to prime incoming graduate students on&nbsp;what it takes to&nbsp;succeed in graduate school. One session dealt with&nbsp;writing good abstracts. You have heard the usual&nbsp;advice: keep it short and simple, avoid jargon, write it for a general reader, etc.

I thought that it would be fun to test&nbsp;whether following this type of advice increases&nbsp;readership (citations). After a few months,&nbsp;I pitched this idea to my&nbsp;friend [James Evans](http://www.knowledgelab.org/people/detail/james_a_evans/), and we decided to try it out with the help of [Cody Weinberger](http://www.codyweinberger.com/page-cv/), an undergraduate student in my laboratory.

We collected&nbsp;about 1M abstracts from 8 disciplines, and we tested the impact of&nbsp;following the usual advice&nbsp;on&nbsp;citations, once accounted for obvious factors such as age of the article, journal where it was published, etc. To our surprise, we found that following some of the most common suggestions&nbsp;leads to a significant decrease in citations!

The short article starts with&nbsp;a quote from Boyle's "Proemial Essay". Robert Boyle was one of the main proponents&nbsp;of the use of "modern" scientific articles to disseminate science (i.e., instead of books). Amusingly, while describing the advantages of this approach, Boyle already states some guidelines&nbsp;on how the essays should be written: we've been told how should we write our science for at least 350 years!

**Update:** [The Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/article/In-a-Paradox-Study-Finds-That/230541/) features a Q&A with Cody.
