In a new paper, Jacopo, Gyuri and I studied the persistence of metapopulations living in a landscape where patches of suitable habitat are scattered randomly.

We found strong connections between metapopulation theory, the mathematics of [Random Geometric Graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_geometric_graph), and the [physics of disordered systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9906135). You can find the paper here:

A bit on the backstory: in December 2014, I gave a talk at UC Davis, and, at dinner, [Sebastian Schreiber](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/sschreiber/)&nbsp;mentioned that if I liked problems involving eigenvalues I should have looked at the classic [Hanski & Ovaskainen model](http://www.helsinki.fi/~ihanski/Articles/Nature%202000%20Hanski%20&%20Ovaskainen.pdf). Back in Chicago, Gyuri (who had just started his postdoc) and Jacopo (who was visiting from Italy) thought it would be a good project to&nbsp;jumpstart our collaboration...
